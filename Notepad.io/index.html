            <!--<p>
                I'm <span id="age-counter">15</span> years old.
            </p>-->
            <p class="about-me-text">
                I've always loved playing around with computers and telling them what to do, ever since I was a little kid.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me-text">
                When I was 10, I started making small Python games and Minecraft mods and plugins. Playing around with my
                new games and sharing them with my family, friends, and online forums was the only thing I liked more than
                making them. Soon I discovered GitHub, where I could share my projects with other programmers like myself.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me-text">
                A few years later, I started to move from small Python games and Minecraft plugins/mods to web development in
                PHP. I also learned a lot about server administration from my time using PHP.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me-text">
                After getting fed up with PHP and all its weird/annoying "features", I moved on and started using Node.js,
                Django Python, and Ruby on Rails. Node.js has been my go-to language for backend web development for quite
                some time, while Java and Python get called in when the time is right.
            </p>
			<p class="about-me-text">
                On my FRC Robotics Team, <a href="http://sert2521.org">SERT</a>, I have used a wide variety of languages,
				from Java to JavaScript to Python and more. My skills using developer tools such as git were not the only
				thing to improve - I also learned new frameworks such as OpenCV for vision detection.

                            it is 100% free! It's built in React Native, and is definitely the largest project I've worked
                            on. Some features include viewing your activity feed and notifications, creating, commenting on,
                            and moderating issues, and interacting with repositories.

                            hltv-livescore is most likely my largest project in terms of users and functionality.
                            It originated as a fork of Nils Margotti's amazing work with
                            <a href="https://github.com/andrewda/hltv-livescore" target="_blank" class="colored">hltv-scorebot</a>,
                            but evolved into a much larger project which works with more recent versions of the HLTV scoreboard
                            and has more functionality. I am most proud of this project, as it has very clean code (in my
                            opinion) and utilizes only two external modules. In addition, it has also attracted a large audience
                            and I hope it has come in handy for the many users!

                            hltv-live-games is another one of my HLTV-related modules. This module will emit an event every
                            time a game goes live on HLTV and has a valid matchid. You can safely expect more things to come
                            from this module as I'm always implementing new features!

                            using Cloudflare (which I had already used for numerous other websites, including this one) and
                            website management in general. The website is currently hosted using GitHub pages, allowing all
                            South Eugene Robotics Team members to make new posts and update the site with new information,
                            which is much better than our previous Squarespace approach.

                            I've used Node.js for most of my major projects, as mentioned above. Ever since starting to use
                            it in early 2015, I've loved the language and have grown very familiar with many major modules,
                            such as Express, Async, Lodash, Request, and more. Along with my Node.js knowledge, I also
                            actively use Django Python and Ruby on Rails to create backend web applications.

                            Angular.js and React go hand-in-hand with Node.js, and therefore I've used them right alongside
                            many of my Node.js websites. They provide simple two-way data binding between the frontend and
                            the backend, which makes them ideal for any application where data binding is usefull.

                            I've used Jekyll many times in the past to create blog-aware websites such as the new South
                            Eugene Robotics Team website, which may be viewed by visiting

                            I am also in the process of converting this site to use Jekyll, as well.

                            Linux is an extraordinarily useful operating system when it comes to development. I've managed
                            many Linux servers using the command-line interface and run many websites and applications on
                            Linux VPS's.

                            I've used Nginx extensively for load-balancing applications and websites. Nginx makes load-
                            balancing a breeze, and keeps servers running incredibly fast.

                            Security and DNS Management are both incredibly important for every website. Fortunately, tools
                            such as Cloudflare allow easy management of both, and I've used them to protect many servers
                            from DDoS attacks and nasty web-scraping bots.

                            Working on creating robot software with the South Eugene Robotics Team has helped me not only
                            refine my Java skills, but also refine my productivity in a team environment. Working on robot
                            software has been incredibly challenging at times, but simultaneously incredibly rewarding.

                            the objective.

                            I've been using Git and GitHub for many years and, over that time, have learned the best practices
                            and have developed many Git related skills to maximize the utility of version control. I started
                            out by using GUI interfaces to interact with Git and GitHub, but have found overtime that the
                            command-line interface provides much more utility and simplicity.
